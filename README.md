# Ever wished to get features from Apple Intelligence like a smarter Siri on your unsupported Mac?

## This new program works on systems with macOS 11.5+

## It provides access to a chat bot using a very powerful language model, allowing it to be very smart. It uses a privately hosted worker model which we host. That means NONE of your data will EVER be sold off. It is ran on a private domain owned by us, and we do NOT sell your data. All chats are private, no one else can see what you say.

Because we run our AI model on a seperate server, this can run on a mac of any power because the model doesn't run On-Device.

Enjoy!

Voice chatting coming soon.
